# Lifecycle - Supply of Verified Ecological Credits

The creation of carbon credits, a type of ecological benefit token, is the process of creating verified supply. The verification process should result in the creation of a high quality digital asset, a credit token, whose value can easily be determined and also quickly be compared with other tokens of the same type. However, all of the data needed to verify the integrity and value of the token should not all reside within the token itself, but be available in other data constructs involved in the verification process.

## Roles

The process or workflow for creating verified supply involves 3 roles:

- A project owner or developer - this is the entity (person or company) that owns the project whose activities will be the source of benefit claims that are verified to create a credit.
- A verifier - the entity who performs the actions needed to verify the benefit claims issued by a project. Claims and verification should be based on a scientific standard for measuring the results of the activity being conducted by the project.
- A registry - the entity that establishes the scientific standard that the claims are based on and the rules for verifying them. A verifier is certified to verify claims against the established standard and once verified, the registry creates the verified carbon credit that represents the actual intangible value that becomes the property of the project owner that created the claim.

## Tokens

The roles in the supply process use two basic types of token definitions to record their activities.

### [Ecological Project or Program](ep.md) - the established identity and properties defining the common understanding of an ecological project that will create ecological benefit claims

### [Ecological Benefit](ccp.md) - the token that references the verified benefit credit recorded in a registry, that is issued by the registry to the project owner

## Contracts

The relationship between the ecological project, verifier and registry is established in a [Verification Contract](verification.md). The contract establishes the terms and conditions for the submission of ecological benefit claims by the project to the verifier, the standard used and the issuance of tokens after a successful verification process.
