# Lifecycle - Buying and Trading Contracts

Here contracts that span across emissions and credits like a Delivery vs. Payment contract for trading offsets for another established value (money). The VEM will align with the recommendations issued by the [TSVCM](https://www.iif.com/tsvcm) operating committee to shape the drafts for each of the below contract types.

## Standard Reference Contracts

TBD Defined:

- Spot
- Forward
- Futures

## Buyer Preference for Offsets

Buyers in a voluntary marketplace can send a demand signal through their [ESG Scorecard](../demand/ESG-Scorecard.md), but will also need to be able to search for and trade credits based on their properties. Buyer preference can be based on classification, i.e. reduction vs. removal and natural vs. technology, or more complex based on a set of conditions like co-benefits, source geography, etc.

## Voluntary Buyer Use Cases

As a voluntary market can offer both standardized carbon credits like a commodity, a.k.a. a standard reference contract that is fungible with other credits in the same class, or can be non-fungible custom contracts that can differ in value and also be bundled together based on their Core Carbon Attributes, an implementation should have searchable parameters.

Using the specifications for [Ecological Projects](../credits/ecological-project.md), [Core Carbon Principle Credits](../credits/ccp.md) and [Verification Contracts](../credits/verification.md), buyers should be able build queries to find products based on their buyer preferences.
