# Lifecycle - Buying and Trading Contracts

Here contracts that span across emissions and credits like a Delivery vs. Payment contract for trading offsets for another established value (money). The VEM will align with the recommendations issued by the [TSVCM](https://www.iif.com/tsvcm) operating committee to shape the drafts for each of the below contract types.

## Standard Reference Contracts

TBD Defined:

- Spot
- Forward: a private and customizable agreement that settles at the end of the agreement and is traded over-the-counter.
- Futures: a standardized terms contract, traded on an exchange, where prices are settled on a daily basis until the end of the contract.
 
## Buyer Preference for Offsets

Buyers in a voluntary marketplace can send a demand signal through their [ESG Scorecard](../demand/ESG-Scorecard.md), but will also need to be able to search for and trade credits based on their properties. Buyer preference can be based on a classification filter, e.g. 
  - reduction vs. removal
  - natural vs. technology
  - co-benefits types
  - source geography
  - Vintage
  - Durability
  - Methodology
  - etc

## Voluntary Buyer Use Cases

A voluntary market can offer standardized carbon credit baskets like a commodity, a.k.a. a standard reference contract that is fungible with other credits in the same class or basket.  These could also be structured around compliance market standards such that a voluntary offset could also meet the requirements of California Cap and Trade.  Additionally, carbon offsets can be non-fungible custom contracts that can differ in value and also be bundled together based on their Core Carbon Attributes.  Both fungible and non-fungible offsets should have searchable parameters.

Using the specifications for [Ecological Projects](../credits/ecological-project.md), [Core Carbon Principle Credits](../credits/ccp.md) and [Verification Contracts](../credits/verification.md), buyers should be able build queries to find products based on their buyer preferences.
